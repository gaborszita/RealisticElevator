# Contributing

If you think you can add something useful to the project and have already implemented it, please submit a pull request! On the other hand, if you have an idea for this project, but didn't implement it, don't be afraid to reach out to us. The best way to tell us your suggestion is to create an issue. We accept suggestions from everyone - coders, non-coders, and people who are just casual Minecraft players enjoying this plugin can all tell us what they would like to have in this plugin.

## Code rules

- We mainly follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), with one exception: The **column limit is 80 characters**, instead of the 100 characters in Google's style.
- **Indentation is 2 spaces.** This is a strict requirement, people submitting pull requests with indentation other than 2 spaces will be rejected. We want a clean, nice-looking code and having different indentation sizes makes code look messy.
- **Write Javadocs for all methods.** If you created a new method, or updated one, please write/update the Javadoc for it.
- **Write comments for your methods.** If your method is short and its Javadoc clearly explains what it does, there is no need for comments in your method. However, if you have a large method, say more than 50 lines, consider adding a few comments to it. This is an open-source project, so we want to make sure everyone can understand what the code does.

That is all. Happy coding!
